## CRITICAL: Read This Before Using Appian MCP Tools

**Stop.** If you are about to call Appian MCP tools (`createRecordType`, `addRecordTypeRelationship`, `createInterface`, etc.), you MUST load reference files from this skill first.

**Why this matters:**

MCP tool schemas describe **parameters** (what fields exist), but not **domain requirements** (how to use them correctly):

- ❌ Tool schema: "`createRecordType` accepts `name`, `fields`, `sourceType`"
- ✅ Skill reference: "Primary key must be named `id` (INTEGER), USER fields require SYSTEM_RECORD_TYPE_USER relationships, relationships need both MANY_TO_ONE + ONE_TO_MANY declarations"

**Without this skill, you will:**
- Create broken relationships (missing reverse sides)
- Use wrong naming conventions (404 errors, convention violations)
- Omit mandatory relationships (USER fields won't display correctly)
- Create objects in wrong order (dependency failures)
- Fabricate UUIDs (silent data corruption)

**Before calling ANY Appian MCP tool, follow the loading strategy below.**

## Tool Surface

Appian MCP tools have names like `createApplication`, `createRecordType`, `addRecordTypeRelationship`, `listInterfaces`, `getProcessModel`. If you see these in your tool list (regardless of prefix), this skill is MANDATORY.

Tool schemas are self-describing for parameter structure. Load `references/tools-mcp.md` for usage patterns, UUID handling, and non-obvious behaviors the schemas don't communicate.

## Resource Reference Map

Each resource has a dedicated reference file with JSON schemas, design conventions, and pitfalls **that tool schemas cannot express**. 

**Loading is NOT optional** — reference files contain mandatory requirements (naming rules, relationship patterns, dependency constraints) that will cause failures if ignored.

Load the relevant reference(s) for your task:

| When to load | Reference File |
|---|---|
| You need usage patterns for the Appian MCP tools | `references/tools-mcp.md` |
| Creating or managing an application | `references/applications.md` |
| Creating/modifying record types, fields, relationships, views, or actions | `references/record-types.md` |
| Requirements mention filtering, searching, faceted navigation, or record list dropdowns | `references/record-type-user-filters.md` |
| Creating/modifying interfaces or writing SAIL form expressions | `references/interfaces.md` |
| Creating/modifying expression rules | `references/expression-rules.md` |
| Creating/modifying process models, adding nodes, or wiring start forms | `references/process-models.md` |
| Creating/modifying sites or adding pages | `references/sites.md` |
| Creating constants, groups, folders, or documents | `references/supporting-objects.md` |
| Designing a data model, choosing entity structure, or normalizing fields into lookup tables | `references/data-modeling.md` |
| Writing SAIL expressions for interfaces (layout, components, patterns) | `references/sail.md` |
| Using Appian functions, operators, or type conversions in expressions | `references/expressions.md` |
| Configuring security roles, record-level security, or group hierarchy | `references/security.md` |
| Configuring security expressions, group hierarchies, or role-based access patterns | `references/security-patterns.md` |
| Starting a multi-object task — need to plan dependency order and scope | `references/change-planning.md` |
| Validating or testing completed changes | `references/change-review.md` |
| Choosing field types or need type constraints (length, precision) | `references/field-types.md` |
| Configuring record events, writing events in process models, displaying event history in interfaces, or enabling process mining (Process HQ). Requirements mention: auditing, activity log, event history, tracking changes, collaboration on records, process mining. | `references/record-events.md` |
| Building a dashboard, form layout, or summary view | `references/ui-patterns.md` |
| Need to look up a specific SAIL component's parameters | `references/component-reference.md` |

### MANDATORY Loading Strategy

**Before calling any Appian MCP tools, load reference files in this order:**

#### Step 1: ALWAYS Load Tool Patterns First
```
Load: references/tools-mcp.md
```
This covers UUID handling, update behaviors, CSV formats, and tool-specific conventions. **Non-negotiable for all Appian tasks.**

#### Step 2: Load Primary Domain Reference
Use the Resource Reference Map above to identify which reference file matches your task, then load it.

**Common scenarios:**
- Creating record types → Load `references/record-types.md` AND `references/data-modeling.md`
- Adding relationships → Load `references/relationship-patterns.md`
- Building interfaces → Load `references/interfaces.md` AND `references/sail.md`
- Creating process models → Load `references/process-models.md` AND `references/node-types.md`

#### Step 3: Load Supplementary References
Based on what you discover in Step 2, load additional references:
- Field type constraints → `references/field-types.md`
- Security configuration → `references/security.md`
- Multi-object tasks → `references/change-planning.md`

#### Step 4: Only Now Call MCP Tools
After loading references, you have the domain knowledge to call tools correctly.

**Validation checklist before calling tools:**
- [ ] Loaded `references/tools-mcp.md`?
- [ ] Loaded primary domain reference for this task?
- [ ] Understand naming conventions (table names, field names, relationship names)?
- [ ] Understand dependency order (what must exist before creating this object)?
- [ ] Have actual UUIDs from environment (not fabricated)?
- [ ] Know which relationships are mandatory (e.g., USER fields → SYSTEM_RECORD_TYPE_USER)?

## Dependency Order

Appian objects must be created in dependency order. Later objects reference earlier ones:

1. Application (creates default groups and folders)
2. Groups (additional role groups)
3. Folders (additional sub-folders)
4. Constants (reference groups, store config values)
5. Record types (with fields)
6. Record type relationships (requires all record types to exist)
7. Expression rules
8. Interfaces
9. Process models
10. Record type actions, views, filters (reference process models and interfaces)
11. Sites (reference interfaces)
12. Web APIs
13. Documents (uploaded to folders)

## Common Failure Modes (What Happens When You Skip Skills)

These are real errors that occur when MCP tools are called without loading reference files:

**❌ Skipping USER field relationships:**
- Symptom: USER fields display as plain text (no name, email, profile picture)
- Cause: Created USER field but didn't add MANY_TO_ONE relationship to SYSTEM_RECORD_TYPE_USER
- Prevention: Load `references/record-types.md` + `references/relationship-patterns.md` (documents mandatory USER field pattern)

**❌ Creating only one side of relationship:**
- Symptom: Can navigate Ticket → Status but not Status → Tickets in UI
- Cause: Created MANY_TO_ONE from Ticket to Status, but missing ONE_TO_MANY reverse relationship
- Prevention: Load `references/relationship-patterns.md` (documents bidirectional requirement)

**❌ Wrong naming conventions:**
- Symptom: 404 errors, convention violations, failed validations
- Cause: Used `statusName` instead of `name` for lookup tables, or `customerId` as primary key instead of `id`
- Prevention: Load `references/data-modeling.md` (documents naming rules)

**❌ Fabricating UUIDs:**
- Symptom: Silent failures, 404 Not Found, data corruption
- Cause: Guessed UUID format or reused UUIDs from different environments
- Prevention: Load `references/tools-mcp.md` (documents UUID sourcing rules)

**❌ Wrong dependency order:**
- Symptom: Creation fails because referenced object doesn't exist yet
- Cause: Created interface before creating the record type it references
- Prevention: Load `references/change-planning.md` (documents dependency sequence)

**❌ Creating application without group hierarchy:**
- Symptom: Flat group structure (all groups at same level), no permission inheritance, missing group constants for security expressions
- Cause: Called `createApplication` and `createGroup` without loading `security-patterns.md`
- Example: Created role groups (e.g., "PREFIX Managers", "PREFIX Workers", "PREFIX Reviewers") but didn't set parent-child relationships → manual permission management required on every object
- Prevention: Load `references/applications.md` → redirects to `references/security-patterns.md` for group hierarchy template

## Universal Tips

- Always discover what exists before creating (list before create)
- Get an object before updating it — updates replace provided fields entirely
- Store UUIDs in variables for multi-step workflows
- Record type relationships require both sides declared (MANY_TO_ONE + ONE_TO_MANY)
- All `recordType!` references in expressions must use UUID-qualified format: `'recordType!{uuid}Name.fields.{fieldUuid}fieldName'`
